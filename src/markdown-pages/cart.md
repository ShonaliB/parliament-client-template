# cart

## Description

A cart is an uncompleted transaction. When a customer prepares to checkout, they store the items they want to purchase in a cart first. Carts can also be converted to completed transactions which charges the customer. To do so, ensure the customer involved has a saved default_payment_method which includes a working payment card. Modify the cart with a PATCH or a PUT so the customer_uri matches the customer you want to charge. You can also just pass in the customer_id if you don't have the full uri. Once that is done, submit an HTTP POST to the cart resource to complete the transaction.

To create a link to this cart which includes the session information you need for a browser, POST to the create_session link relationship.

## Properties

Property Description Type Constraints
customer_uri
The full API URI of the customer this cart is associated with. You can not POST a cart into a transaction (ie. charge a customer's saved payment method) unless this value is set to a valid customer with an active default payment method.

Guest (ie. is_anonymous=1 customer resources can be used, but be aware that guest customer payment methods are purged regularly and according to various internal criteria. As such, so you should not rely on a guest customer's saved credit card being usable indefinitely. In general, you shouldn't rely on a saved payment method persisting more than 60 days, though this value is subject to change. (And, of course, there's no guarantee for any saved payment method that it will work in the future, so always be sure to handle payment errors on your end.)

Note that when this value is included, the customer's shipping*\* and billing*\* values will populate and override any existing values on the cart resource (unless the address values are PUT or PATCHed in the same request, in which case the explicitly set values will be used).

Note that if you are using the customer_uri value, you'll likely either want to explicitly set the use_customer_shipping_address value.

URL Obtained from the self link relation of a customer.
use*customer_shipping_address This value determines how an attached customer's addresses should be handled in the event the cart resource is POSTed to. When false, the customer's billing address will be used for both the billing and shipping addresses. Defaults to true, so a customer's shipping address will be used if it exists. Boolean True or false, 1 or 0.
billing*\_, shipping\__
You can override the address values populated by the customer*uri. Note that if you do so, you should explicitly set all shipping*_ and billing\_\_, including blank values. For instance, if you PATCH to set a different address, ensure you pass through an empty shipping_address2 value, or the existing value from the customer_uri will remain.

Also note that if a customer_uri is added after addresses are set, the customer's billing and shipping addresses will overwrite what you have set explicitly, as noted above.

Please see the customer_addresses documentation for the acceptable values.

Mixed Mixed
template_set_uri The full API URI of the template set for this cart, if one has been specified. URL Obtained from the self link relation of a template set.

total_future_shipping If this cart has any shippable subscription items which will process in the future, this will be the total amount of shipping costs for those items. Decimal (note: live shipping rate calculations do not currently work for this API)
total_order Total order amount of this cart including all items, taxes, shipping costs and discounts. Decimal Read only
